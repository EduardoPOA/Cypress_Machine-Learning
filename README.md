# Cypress_Machine-Learning

This is a project that does not require using the Test Runner's Inspect Element in Cypress. 
You can simply use CSS selectors from the browser's inspector as well as absolute XPath. 
This project contains custom methods that make validations easier,
and automatically handle element corrections to prevent exceptions.
